This is a basic Flask application that demonstrates a timeout scenario. It includes a `/timeout` route that intentionally delays the response by 35 seconds.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Flask (version X.X.X)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
$ cd your-project

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required dependencies:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

$ python your_app.py

markdown
Copy code

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the homepage.

## Routes

### `/`

- Description: Displays a welcome message.
- Method: GET
- Response: "Hello welcome to myassignment"

### `/timeout`
